        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 fertilized duck egg (balut)</li>
            <li>Water (for boiling)</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>Vinegar (optional, for dipping)</li>
            <li>Chili (optional, for dipping)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by placing the fertilized duck eggs in a saucepan or pot. Add enough water to cover the eggs.</li>
            <li>Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, lower the heat and let the eggs simmer for about 30 to 40 minutes, depending on how well-cooked you like the yolk and embryo.</li>
            <li>Once the eggs are cooked, carefully remove them from the water and let them cool for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Once cool enough to handle, gently tap the egg on the side to crack the shell. Peel off the shell carefully, starting from the pointed end.</li>
            <li>Once the shell is removed, you'll see the liquid inside. You can sip the broth or discard it, depending on your preference.</li>
            <li>After peeling the shell, you can eat the embryo, the yolk, and the white, all of which are considered delicacies.</li>
            <li>Balut is typically served with a pinch of salt, and sometimes vinegar and chili are used as dipping sauces.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your authentic Filipino street food!</li>
